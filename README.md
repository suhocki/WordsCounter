The project is created by Maksim Sukhotski as part of the `Teladoc Health Senior Mobile Engineer Interview Assessment`.

Algorithms and Data Structures

# Task

Included with this assignment is the file Romeo-and-Juliet.txt. It is a classic tale of family, death and forbidden love! Write an application that will read this file and generate a list of all word occurrences. Label each word with the frequency with which it is used. The application should display the results in a TableView / RecyclerView ordered from most to least frequently used.
Extra credit: Build a control that allows the table view to sort itself instead alphabetically or by character length of the word.
